I'll update this as your guy's contributions come in, TC.

  We're using SFML to parse the images.  Michael has provided the object file in
addition to the code to make compilation a little bit easier if you don't have
SFML installed.  The documentation to installed SFML on you system is here 
under [Getting Started](http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.3/).
